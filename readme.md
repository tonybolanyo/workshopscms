## Workshops CMS ##

This is my first node.js / express.js production site. Workshops CMS allows you to control a catalog of workshops where users can register in a workshop and you can manage workshops details, registration, attendees...

It's in a development stage so, most of the time it isn't working as it must be. I use this project to learn new skills, and to practice old ones.

I'll make this public under GNU Public License.

## Installing and running ##

Download a copy of the project and install dependencies packages

```
npm install
```

To start server:

```
